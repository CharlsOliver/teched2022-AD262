# Preparation

Let's start the exercise and see whether everything is ready to go.
Please make sure you have all the necessary prerequisites listed below. If not, please raise your voice during the meeting so that we can assist you early in the session.

## Prerequisites
Please keep the following links and resources available:

1. You need a browser, preferably Google Chrome
1. Logon to the Development Lobby  
https://lcapteched-applicationdevelopment.lcnc.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/lobby
1. Your user is assigned to you by the moderator of the tutorial. It has the format **lowcodeuser+XXX@gmail.com where XXX is a number**.
1. Your password will also be revealed to you by the moderator of the tutorial
1. **In almost every chapter of this tutorial there is a reference to the number XXX from your user, so a 3 digit number like 001. Make sure that you remember it well.** It is important as we will use these numbers, where every user has a different one, in order to create different names for applications and other artifacts. As we will deploy all the the artifacts to the same Business Technology Platform account, it is important that they all differ in the names and identifiers, so there are no clashes
1. Optional: If you read this before the workshop has actually started you can invoke the following URL: https://lcapteched.eu10cf.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/index.html?origin=LCAP&pack=LCAP&gen-type=yo&yo-gen-name=@ext-lcapvsc-npm-dev/lcap&yo-arg1=Capex&root-dir=test&folder=/home/user/projects/test You will then see an image like this:
![](/exercises/ex0/images/LCAP_01.png)
It will take several minutes (5 or so) until it switches to the next view, you have now entered the Business Application Studio and you can just close the browser window again.
What is this good for? When as a user you enter the Business Application Studio for the first time on a BTP account it is set up for you in the background. A so-called dev space is created for you with all the content that is needed for low code application development. You can compare this to a new computer that is handed to you and is now set up, including all the low code software that is needed for development. If you have done this step upfront, the entry time into the Business Application Studio when the real exercises begin is smaller. If you haven't done it, that's not a problem either, you just wait a bit longer for the first time.

## General troubleshooting


1. If you encounter an issue with the Low-Code perspective in the Business Application Studio (BAS) you can check the logs under: File > Open > /home/user/lcap.home.2022-11-16.log (if you encounter the issue at any other day, you need to update the file name with the date of that day)

1. If something does not work in the editor, but it should, you can try restarting the whole workspace. To do so, open this URL: https://lcapteched.eu10cf.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/index.html?alldevspaces=true.  
Here you see the so-called Dev Spaces of the Business application studio. Click on the "Stop" button. Once the Dev Space stopped, you can simply restart it. In order to go back to your Low-Code perspective you must go through the lobby - located here:
